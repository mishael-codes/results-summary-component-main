## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### What I learned

I started this project with the aim of learning how to use tailwindcss and I can say that I have learnt quite a  bit about it. Ilearnt hoe to create my personal variables with tailwind. I used this for colors and it was easy to remember and assign each element its required colors. I also learnt how some of the default classes work and how tailwind differs from bootstrap

### Continued development

For this particular project, I want to use the data.json file to dynamically get the scores.
For other projects, I want to continue learning about and utilizing the tailwind framework.
